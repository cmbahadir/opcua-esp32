# OPC UA Server on ESP32

OPC UA server runnning on ESP32 board with a minimal information model to control on-board relays of ESP32-EVB development board from Olimex. Also with a temperature node reading over GPIO 4 from a DHT-22 sensor.

    DHT22 Sensor : GPIO 4
    RELAY 0      : GPIO 32
    RELAY 1      : GPIO 33

It is tested with UAExpert and Matrikon Mobile IOS OPC UA Client. If you see any problems with other clients please open an issue.

### Prerequisites

- Hardware : Development is based on [ESP32-EVB](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/ESP32-EVB/open-source-hardware) from Olimex but any ESP32 board is expected to work.
- ESP-IDF : https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/

## Getting Started
Blog post with more information: [Selftronics](https://selftronics.com/2020/06/23/cheapest-embedded-opc-ua-server/)

It is required to have [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) and configured in local.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git <your-esp-idf-root-path>
    cd <your-esp-idf-root-path>
    ./install.sh
    source export.sh
    cd <your-esp-idf-root-path>/examples/
    git clone https://github.com/cmbahadir opcua-esp32
    cd opcua-esp32
    idf.py build
    
Open62541.c and open62541.h are amalgamated OPC UA C stack files. If you are interested more on the OPC UA stack, please check Open62541 project.

If you want to build open62541.c/.h/.lib from source, be sure to apply the changes in [here](https://github.com/cmbahadir/opcua-esp32/blob/master/components/open62541lib/README.md) to make it compatible with FreeRTOS and xtensa-toolchain.

- I haven't analyzed these modifications in open62541.c/.h  files, these are just a result of trial and error process, but open62541 project is still being developed to make it easier. I would suggest to follow [this](https://github.com/open62541/open62541/pull/2511#issuecomment-732238526) long but full of practical information thread to overcome the problems about compiling open62541's with FreeRTOS.

- OPC UA stack: [Open62541](https://github.com/open62541/open62541)

### Configuration
Type of connection, Wi-Fi SSID, password and static ip configuration can be set through esp-idf's menuconfig tool. It is required to set a DNS address when using static IP address. Connection can be configured from under "Connection configuration" on configuration menu run by executing the command:

    idf.py menuconfig
